# Deep Learning Mini Projects

This is a series of personal mini projects made on jupyter notebooks and written in Python to explore and master the various concepts of deep learning.

Each notebook has it's own dedicated folder and is accompanied by a pdf for visualization if necessary. And each of these folders are grouped in function of their purpose on this repository main folder.
