# Machine Learning Mini Projects

This is a series of personal mini projects made on jupyter notebooks and written in Python to explore and master the various concepts of deep learning.

Each notebook has it's own dedicated folder and is accompanied by a pdf and a html for visualization if necessary. The html file has a better representation of the notebook, but should be downloaded and opened in the browser. 

Each of these folders are grouped in function of their purpose on this repository main folder.
